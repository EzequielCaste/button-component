The demo for the solution to this challenge is hosted at Vercel. I used Next.js and SASS.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/5ZnOYsSXM24JWnCsNFlt) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- [X] User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text
- [X] User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
- [X] User story: I can choose to disable button
- [X] User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- [X] User story:: I can have different button sizes
- [X] User story: I can have different colors
- [X] User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- [X] User story: I can still access all button attributes
- [X] User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough
